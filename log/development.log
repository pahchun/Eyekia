VCR::Errors::UnhandledHTTPRequestError (

================================================================================
An HTTP request has been made that VCR does not know how to handle:
  PUT https://ikea-reviews.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/profile_photo/12/photo.jpg

There is currently no cassette in use. There are a few ways
you can configure VCR to handle this request:

  * If you're surprised VCR is raising this error
    and want insight about how VCR attempted to handle the request,
    you can use the debug_logger configuration option to log more details [1].
  * If you want VCR to record this request and play it back during future test
    runs, you should wrap your test (or this portion of your test) in a
    `VCR.use_cassette` block [2].
  * If you only want VCR to handle requests made while a cassette is in use,
    configure `allow_http_connections_when_no_cassette = true`. VCR will
    ignore this request since it is made when there is no cassette [3].
  * If you want VCR to ignore this request (and others like it), you can
    set an `ignore_request` callback [4].

VCR::Errors::UnhandledHTTPRequestError (

================================================================================
An HTTP request has been made that VCR does not know how to handle:
  PUT https://ikea-reviews.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/profile_photo/13/photo.jpg

There is currently no cassette in use. There are a few ways
you can configure VCR to handle this request:

  * If you're surprised VCR is raising this error
    and want insight about how VCR attempted to handle the request,
    you can use the debug_logger configuration option to log more details [1].
  * If you want VCR to record this request and play it back during future test
    runs, you should wrap your test (or this portion of your test) in a
    `VCR.use_cassette` block [2].
  * If you only want VCR to handle requests made while a cassette is in use,
    configure `allow_http_connections_when_no_cassette = true`. VCR will
    ignore this request since it is made when there is no cassette [3].
  * If you want VCR to ignore this request (and others like it), you can
    set an `ignore_request` callback [4].

VCR::Errors::UnhandledHTTPRequestError (

================================================================================
An HTTP request has been made that VCR does not know how to handle:
  PUT https://ikea-reviews.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/profile_photo/19/photo.jpg

There is currently no cassette in use. There are a few ways
you can configure VCR to handle this request:

  * If you're surprised VCR is raising this error
    and want insight about how VCR attempted to handle the request,
    you can use the debug_logger configuration option to log more details [1].
  * If you want VCR to record this request and play it back during future test
    runs, you should wrap your test (or this portion of your test) in a
    `VCR.use_cassette` block [2].
  * If you only want VCR to handle requests made while a cassette is in use,
    configure `allow_http_connections_when_no_cassette = true`. VCR will
    ignore this request since it is made when there is no cassette [3].
  * If you want VCR to ignore this request (and others like it), you can
    set an `ignore_request` callback [4].

VCR::Errors::UnhandledHTTPRequestError (

================================================================================
An HTTP request has been made that VCR does not know how to handle:
  PUT https://ikea-reviews.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/profile_photo/20/photo.jpg

There is currently no cassette in use. There are a few ways
you can configure VCR to handle this request:

  * If you're surprised VCR is raising this error
    and want insight about how VCR attempted to handle the request,
    you can use the debug_logger configuration option to log more details [1].
  * If you want VCR to record this request and play it back during future test
    runs, you should wrap your test (or this portion of your test) in a
    `VCR.use_cassette` block [2].
  * If you only want VCR to handle requests made while a cassette is in use,
    configure `allow_http_connections_when_no_cassette = true`. VCR will
    ignore this request since it is made when there is no cassette [3].
  * If you want VCR to ignore this request (and others like it), you can
    set an `ignore_request` callback [4].

VCR::Errors::UnhandledHTTPRequestError (

================================================================================
An HTTP request has been made that VCR does not know how to handle:
  PUT https://ikea-reviews.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/profile_photo/59/photo.jpg

There is currently no cassette in use. There are a few ways
you can configure VCR to handle this request:

  * If you're surprised VCR is raising this error
    and want insight about how VCR attempted to handle the request,
    you can use the debug_logger configuration option to log more details [1].
  * If you want VCR to record this request and play it back during future test
    runs, you should wrap your test (or this portion of your test) in a
    `VCR.use_cassette` block [2].
  * If you only want VCR to handle requests made while a cassette is in use,
    configure `allow_http_connections_when_no_cassette = true`. VCR will
    ignore this request since it is made when there is no cassette [3].
  * If you want VCR to ignore this request (and others like it), you can
    set an `ignore_request` callback [4].

VCR::Errors::UnhandledHTTPRequestError (

================================================================================
An HTTP request has been made that VCR does not know how to handle:
  PUT https://ikea-reviews.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/profile_photo/60/photo.jpg

There is currently no cassette in use. There are a few ways
you can configure VCR to handle this request:

  * If you're surprised VCR is raising this error
    and want insight about how VCR attempted to handle the request,
    you can use the debug_logger configuration option to log more details [1].
  * If you want VCR to record this request and play it back during future test
    runs, you should wrap your test (or this portion of your test) in a
    `VCR.use_cassette` block [2].
  * If you only want VCR to handle requests made while a cassette is in use,
    configure `allow_http_connections_when_no_cassette = true`. VCR will
    ignore this request since it is made when there is no cassette [3].
  * If you want VCR to ignore this request (and others like it), you can
    set an `ignore_request` callback [4].
